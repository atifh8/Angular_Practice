  ViewChild allows one component to be injected into another, giving the parent
  access to its attributes and functions. However, the child wonâ€™t be available
  until after the view has been initialized. This means we need to implement the
  <b> AfterViewInit lifecycle hook</b> to receive the data from the child.
